# P4 - Pass

It can be seen, there is no P4 program in this directory, just like in the case of [``Pass``](../../P4/Pass) of wired environment.

In P4, the environment where the use cases will be carried out will be Mininet-WiFi with APs
(``BMv2``) and host. The APs (``BMv2``) are a software switch in which we can inject P4 code, with
which we can define its datapath.
